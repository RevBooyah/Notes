# Notes

A curated set of technical notes, experiments, and architectural sketches across AI, optimization, and complex systems.

This is my working space for ideas in progress — a mix of design decisions, implementation details, and reasoning around systems I’ve built or explored. Some are deep dives into foundational topics; others are quick outlines or in-development research.

## Areas of Focus

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `llm_eval/` | Exploring trust, truthfulness, and chain-of-thought integrity in language models |
| `scheduling/` | Notes on GA-based scheduling, changeover sequencing, and constraint systems |
| `forecasting/` | Demand shaping, residual modeling, and inventory-aware forecasting strategies |
| `agents/` | Planning, memory architectures, and prompt engineering for tool-using LLMs |
| `systems/` | Observability, integration architecture, and SaaS platform decisions |
| `cto_memos/` | Long-form thinking on product tradeoffs, team design, and scale patterns |


## Why This Exists

I’ve worked across AI systems, manufacturing optimization, forecasting, and infrastructure — often at the intersection of **decision-making, automation, and real-world constraints**. These notes help document:
- Models and experiments worth revisiting
- Concepts I’ve had to explain repeatedly (to teams, execs, or myself)
- Unsolved or half-solved problems I think about often


## Guiding Themes

- LLMs as reasoning engines, not just text predictors  
- AI-native interfaces for operational planning and control  
- The hidden complexity of “real-world integration”  
- When to trust a model (and how to know if you shouldn’t)


## Usage

Most folders include:
- `.md` memos (designs, ideas, results)
- Code sketches or notebooks (lightweight or illustrative)
- Pointers to real implementations (when public)

This is not a polished library — it's closer to a technical journal.
